# Repository for Paradigmas de Programacion course

While studying at the [Universidad Nacional de San Martin (UNSAM - Argentina)](http://www.unsam.edu.ar/escuelas/ciencia/107/ciencia/programacion-informatica) me and my partners did a bunch of exercises working with both Haskell and Prolog, this is that main repo.
